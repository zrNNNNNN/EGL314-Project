## Introduction to my **EGL314** Project By Phoa Jian Wei

My EGL314 Project consists of 3 different major projects segments,  being Neopixel Lighting, Mounted Fixture Lighting and Audio Transmission. Currently, I am working on the Neopixel Section where I am supposed to create a 30 second Neopixel 
Sequence that is unique to me.
